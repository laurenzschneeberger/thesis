# Bachelor Thesis

A publicly viewable version of the most important research code for the bachelor thesis 'On the Finite-Sample Behavior of Statistical Factor Models'. 
Running the code on your local machine will require a private WRDS access key to generate most of the data. Some adjustments may have to be made 
to ensure the dependencies between the scripts work properly (e.g. filepaths). 

If questions arise, feel free to [contact](laurenzschneeberger.github.io) me.
